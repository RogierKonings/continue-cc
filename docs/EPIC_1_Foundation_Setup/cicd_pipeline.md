# User Story: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Story Description
As a developer, I want automated testing, building, and release processes through GitHub Actions so that code quality is maintained and releases are consistent and reliable.

## Action Items

### 1. Set Up GitHub Repository
- [x] Create GitHub repository with appropriate .gitignore
- [x] Configure branch protection rules for main branch
- [x] Set up required status checks before merge
- [x] Configure automated security scanning
- [x] Enable Dependabot for dependency updates

### 2. Create Test Automation Workflow
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing
- [x] Configure matrix testing for multiple OS (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- [x] Set up Node.js version matrix (18.x, 20.x)
- [x] Run unit tests with coverage reporting
- [x] Run integration tests for VSCode extension
- [x] Upload coverage reports to Codecov

### 3. Implement Build Workflow
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/build.yml` for build verification
- [x] Build extension for all target platforms
- [x] Verify bundle size stays under threshold
- [x] Run linting and type checking
- [x] Generate build artifacts for manual testing
- [x] Cache dependencies for faster builds

### 4. Configure Release Automation
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases
- [x] Set up semantic versioning with standard-version
- [x] Automate CHANGELOG.md generation
- [x] Build and package extension (.vsix file)
- [x] Create GitHub releases with artifacts
- [x] Prepare for VSCode Marketplace publishing

### 5. Set Up Quality Gates
- [x] Configure SonarCloud for code quality analysis
- [x] Set up bundle size monitoring with size-limit
- [x] Implement performance benchmarking
- [x] Add security scanning with CodeQL
- [x] Configure automated dependency vulnerability checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Push to main triggers all CI checks
- [ ] All tests pass on all supported platforms
- [ ] Build artifacts are automatically generated
- [ ] Release process creates .vsix file and GitHub release
- [ ] Code coverage is above 80%
- [ ] All quality gates pass before merge

## Test Cases

### CI Pipeline Tests
1. **Push to PR**: Should trigger test and build workflows
2. **Merge to Main**: Should trigger all workflows including release prep
3. **Tag Push**: Should trigger release workflow

### Test Automation Tests
1. **Unit Tests**: Run on all OS/Node combinations successfully
2. **Integration Tests**: VSCode extension tests pass
3. **Coverage**: Reports are generated and uploaded

### Build Tests
1. **Development Build**: Completes successfully on all platforms
2. **Production Build**: Generates optimized bundles
3. **Package**: Creates valid .vsix file

### Release Tests
1. **Version Bump**: Semantic versioning works correctly
2. **Changelog**: Automatically generated with correct format
3. **GitHub Release**: Created with all artifacts

## Edge Cases
- Handle flaky tests with retry mechanism
- Support running on forked PRs with limited secrets
- Handle GitHub Actions outages gracefully
- Support manual release override when needed
- Handle large PR with many commits efficiently

## Technical Notes
- Use GitHub Actions cache for node_modules
- Parallelize test jobs for faster feedback
- Use composite actions for reusable workflows
- Consider self-hosted runners for faster builds
- Implement workflow_dispatch for manual triggers

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Project Initialization story
- Blocks: Reliable releases and quality assurance

## Estimated Effort
- 4-6 hours for basic CI/CD setup
- 8-10 hours including all quality gates and optimizations
