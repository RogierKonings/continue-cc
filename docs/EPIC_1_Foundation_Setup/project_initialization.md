# User Story: Project Initialization

## Story Description
As a developer, I want to set up the initial project structure with TypeScript, build system, and development tools so that I can start developing the VSCode extension efficiently.

## Action Items

### 1. Initialize VSCode Extension Project
- [x] Run `yo code` to scaffold a new TypeScript extension
- [x] Select "New Extension (TypeScript)" option
- [x] Configure project metadata (name: claude-code-continue, publisher, description)
- [x] Set minimum VSCode version to 1.95.0

### 2. Configure TypeScript Environment
- [x] Update `tsconfig.json` with strict type checking options
- [x] Set target to ES2022 and module to CommonJS
- [x] Configure path aliases for clean imports (@/src, @/test)
- [x] Enable source maps for debugging

### 3. Set Up Build System with esbuild
- [x] Install esbuild as dev dependency
- [x] Create `esbuild.config.js` with production/development configurations
- [x] Configure bundling for extension and webview separately
- [x] Set up tree-shaking and minification for production builds
- [x] Create npm scripts for build:dev and build:prod

### 4. Configure Code Quality Tools
- [x] Install and configure ESLint with TypeScript plugin
- [x] Set up Prettier with VSCode extension formatting rules
- [x] Create `.eslintrc.json` with recommended rules
- [x] Create `.prettierrc.json` with consistent formatting
- [x] Add pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged

### 5. Set Up Testing Framework
- [x] Install Jest and @types/jest
- [x] Configure Jest for TypeScript with ts-jest
- [x] Set up VSCode extension testing with @vscode/test-electron
- [x] Create test directory structure (unit, integration, e2e)
- [x] Add test scripts to package.json

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project compiles without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Build process produces optimized bundles under 5MB
- [ ] All linting rules pass on initial codebase
- [ ] Sample test runs successfully
- [ ] Extension can be launched in Extension Development Host
- [ ] Source maps work correctly in debugger

## Test Cases

### Build System Tests
1. **Development Build**: Run `npm run build:dev` - should complete in <2 seconds
2. **Production Build**: Run `npm run build:prod` - should produce minified output
3. **Watch Mode**: Run `npm run watch` - should rebuild on file changes

### TypeScript Configuration Tests
1. **Strict Null Checks**: Verify null/undefined errors are caught
2. **Path Aliases**: Import using @/src should resolve correctly
3. **Type Definitions**: VSCode API types should be available

### Linting Tests
1. **ESLint**: Run `npm run lint` - should pass with no errors
2. **Prettier**: Run `npm run format:check` - should show no formatting issues
3. **Pre-commit**: Stage a file with lint errors - commit should fail

### Extension Launch Tests
1. **Debug Launch**: F5 should open new VSCode window with extension loaded
2. **Command Registration**: Extension commands should appear in command palette
3. **Activation**: Extension should activate on workspace open

## Edge Cases
- Handle missing node_modules gracefully
- Build should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Support both npm and pnpm package managers
- Handle VSCode version incompatibilities with clear error messages

## Technical Notes
- Use esbuild's platform: 'node' for main extension
- Use platform: 'browser' for webview content
- External dependencies should be marked in esbuild config
- Consider using Rollup if esbuild limitations are encountered

## Dependencies
- No dependencies on other user stories
- Blocks all other development work

## Estimated Effort
- 4-6 hours for experienced VSCode extension developer
- 8-12 hours including learning curve for build tools
