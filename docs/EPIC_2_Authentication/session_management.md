# User Story: Session Management

## Story Description
As a user, I want my authentication session to be managed securely and persistently so that I don't need to re-authenticate every time I use VSCode.

## Action Items

### 1. Implement Secure Credential Storage
- [ ] Create `CredentialManager` class using VSCode SecretStorage
- [ ] Implement encryption wrapper for additional security
- [ ] Store tokens with metadata (expiry, scopes, user info)
- [ ] Create secure key derivation for storage
- [ ] Implement credential migration for updates

### 2. Create Session Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Implement `SessionManager` class for session state
- [ ] Create session initialization on extension activation
- [ ] Handle session restoration from stored credentials
- [ ] Implement session timeout monitoring
- [ ] Add session event emitters for state changes

### 3. Implement Logout Functionality
- [ ] Create logout command in command palette
- [ ] Implement complete token cleanup on logout
- [ ] Clear all cached user data
- [ ] Revoke tokens with Claude Code API
- [ ] Reset extension state to unauthenticated

### 4. Handle Session Expiration
- [ ] Monitor token expiration timestamps
- [ ] Implement preemptive token refresh
- [ ] Handle refresh token expiration
- [ ] Show user notification for required re-auth
- [ ] Queue API requests during token refresh

### 5. Multi-Account Support Foundation
- [ ] Design account switching architecture
- [ ] Create account identifier system
- [ ] Implement credential namespacing
- [ ] Add account selection UI preparation
- [ ] Create account-specific settings storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sessions persist across VSCode restarts
- [ ] Automatic token refresh works seamlessly
- [ ] Logout completely removes all auth data
- [ ] Session expiration is handled gracefully
- [ ] No authentication prompts during valid session
- [ ] Account switching architecture is extensible

## Test Cases

### Storage Tests
1. **Credential Save**: Tokens saved to SecretStorage successfully
2. **Credential Load**: Tokens restored on extension restart
3. **Credential Update**: Token refresh updates storage
4. **Credential Delete**: Logout removes all credentials

### Session Lifecycle Tests
1. **Session Init**: New session created on first auth
2. **Session Restore**: Valid session restored on restart
3. **Session Expire**: Expired session triggers re-auth
4. **Session Events**: State changes emit correct events

### Logout Tests
1. **Complete Logout**: All auth data removed
2. **API Revocation**: Tokens revoked on server
3. **State Reset**: Extension returns to initial state
4. **Cache Clear**: No user data remains

### Token Refresh Tests
1. **Auto Refresh**: Tokens refresh before expiry
2. **Refresh Failure**: Failed refresh triggers re-auth
3. **Concurrent Refresh**: Multiple requests don't cause race
4. **Queue Requests**: API calls wait for refresh

## Edge Cases
- VSCode SecretStorage unavailable (fallback strategy)
- Corrupted stored credentials
- System time changes affecting expiry
- Network unavailable during refresh
- Multiple VSCode windows with same account
- Credentials accessed from different machines

## Technical Notes
- Use setInterval for token expiry monitoring
- Implement mutex for concurrent refresh prevention
- Store token expiry with 5-minute buffer
- Use event emitter pattern for session changes
- Consider WorkspaceState for non-sensitive data

## Dependencies
- Depends on: OAuth Implementation story
- Blocks: Persistent authentication experience

## Security Considerations
- Never store tokens in plain text
- Clear memory after credential use
- Implement secure random for encryption keys
- Validate stored credential integrity
- Log security events without sensitive data

## Estimated Effort
- 6-8 hours for basic session management
- 10-12 hours including multi-account foundation
