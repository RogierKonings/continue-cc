# User Story: Completion Provider Implementation

## Story Description
As a developer, I want intelligent code completions to appear as I type so that I can write code faster and with fewer errors using Claude Code's AI capabilities.

## Action Items

### 1. Implement VSCode CompletionItemProvider
- [ ] Create `ClaudeCompletionProvider` class implementing vscode.CompletionItemProvider
- [ ] Override provideCompletionItems method
- [ ] Implement completion item creation from AI responses
- [ ] Add completion kind mapping (method, function, variable, etc.)
- [ ] Set up completion item documentation and detail

### 2. Register Provider for Languages
- [ ] Register provider for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Add support for Python
- [ ] Include Java, C++, and Go
- [ ] Configure language-specific trigger characters
- [ ] Set up file extension to language mapping

### 3. Handle Inline Completions
- [ ] Implement vscode.InlineCompletionItemProvider
- [ ] Create ghost text rendering for multi-line completions
- [ ] Handle Tab key acceptance of completions
- [ ] Implement partial acceptance with Ctrl+Right
- [ ] Add escape key cancellation

### 4. Support Multi-line Completions
- [ ] Detect when multi-line completion is appropriate
- [ ] Format multi-line suggestions correctly
- [ ] Preserve indentation in completions
- [ ] Handle nested block completions
- [ ] Implement smart bracket/parenthesis completion

### 5. Configure Completion Behavior
- [ ] Add setting for automatic trigger vs manual
- [ ] Implement minimum character threshold
- [ ] Create completion delay configuration
- [ ] Add option to disable in comments/strings
- [ ] Support workspace-specific settings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Completions appear within 200ms of typing
- [ ] Multi-line completions display correctly
- [ ] Tab accepts completions intuitively
- [ ] All major languages are supported
- [ ] Completions respect code style
- [ ] Settings allow full customization

## Test Cases

### Provider Registration Tests
1. **Language Support**: Provider active for all configured languages
2. **File Types**: Correct provider for each file extension
3. **Activation**: Provider activates on file open
4. **Multiple Providers**: No conflicts with other extensions

### Completion Behavior Tests
1. **Trigger**: Completions appear after typing trigger
2. **Cancellation**: Escape dismisses completions
3. **Acceptance**: Tab inserts full completion
4. **Partial Accept**: Ctrl+Right accepts word by word

### Multi-line Tests
1. **Function Body**: Complete function implementation
2. **Class Definition**: Multi-line class completions
3. **Indentation**: Preserves current indentation
4. **Block Completion**: Handles if/for/while blocks

### Performance Tests
1. **Response Time**: Completions appear <200ms
2. **Large Files**: No lag in 10k+ line files
3. **Concurrent**: Multiple completion requests handled
4. **Memory**: No memory leaks with extended use

## Edge Cases
- Completion at start/end of file
- Mixed tabs and spaces indentation
- Unicode and emoji in completions
- Very long single-line completions
- Completions with special characters
- Read-only files and views
- Split editor scenarios

## Technical Notes
- Use vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider
- Implement dispose() for cleanup
- Cache recent completions for performance
- Use incremental text document sync
- Consider CompletionItemKind for icons

## Dependencies
- Depends on: API client implementation
- Blocks: Core autocomplete functionality

## Performance Considerations
- Debounce completion requests
- Cancel in-flight requests on new input
- Limit completion item count to 10-20
- Use lazy resolution for documentation
- Implement client-side filtering

## Estimated Effort
- 8-10 hours for basic implementation
- 12-16 hours including all languages and edge cases
