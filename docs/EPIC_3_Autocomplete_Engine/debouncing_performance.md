# User Story: Debouncing and Performance Optimization

## Story Description
As a developer, I want completions to be performant and not interfere with my typing flow so that I can code smoothly without lag or unnecessary API calls.

## Action Items

### 1. Implement Intelligent Debouncing
- [ ] Create `DebouncedCompletionManager` class
- [ ] Implement adaptive debounce timing based on typing speed
- [ ] Add different debounce delays for different triggers
- [ ] Create immediate trigger for specific characters (., ->, ::)
- [ ] Implement debounce cancellation on navigation

### 2. Cancel In-flight Requests
- [ ] Implement request cancellation tokens
- [ ] Create `RequestManager` with AbortController
- [ ] Cancel pending requests on new input
- [ ] Handle partial responses gracefully
- [ ] Clean up cancelled request resources

### 3. Implement Completion Cache
- [ ] Create `CompletionCache` with LRU eviction
- [ ] Cache completions by context hash
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation rules
- [ ] Add TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries
- [ ] Create cache size limits and monitoring

### 4. Optimize Context Processing
- [ ] Implement incremental context updates
- [ ] Use diff algorithms for context changes
- [ ] Parallelize context extraction tasks
- [ ] Implement context compression strategies
- [ ] Add context preprocessing cache

### 5. Add Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance metrics collection
- [ ] Track completion latency percentiles
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates
- [ ] Log slow completion requests
- [ ] Create performance debugging commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No perceived lag while typing quickly
- [ ] API calls reduced by >70% with caching
- [ ] Completions appear within 200ms consistently
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 50MB
- [ ] CPU usage <5% during normal coding
- [ ] Graceful degradation under load

## Test Cases

### Debouncing Tests
1. **Fast Typing**: No completions during rapid input
2. **Pause Trigger**: Completion after typing pause
3. **Immediate Trigger**: Instant on dot notation
4. **Cancellation**: Moving cursor cancels request

### Request Management Tests
1. **Cancellation**: Old requests abort properly
2. **Cleanup**: No memory leaks from cancelled requests
3. **Race Conditions**: Latest request wins
4. **Error Handling**: Cancelled requests don't error

### Cache Tests
1. **Cache Hit**: Repeated context uses cache
2. **Cache Miss**: New context fetches from API
3. **Invalidation**: File changes clear cache
4. **Size Limit**: Old entries evicted at limit
5. **TTL**: Expired entries are removed

### Performance Tests
1. **Latency**: P95 latency <200ms
2. **Memory**: <50MB memory usage
3. **CPU**: <5% CPU during coding
4. **Large Files**: No lag in large files
5. **Stress Test**: Handles rapid requests

### Monitoring Tests
1. **Metrics**: All metrics collected accurately
2. **Logging**: Performance logs are useful
3. **Debugging**: Debug commands work
4. **Reporting**: Can export performance data

## Edge Cases
- Network latency variations
- API throttling/rate limits
- Very fast typists (>150 WPM)
- Slow machines/limited resources
- Large workspace with many files
- Concurrent editing in multiple files
- Extension reload during requests

## Technical Notes
- Use setTimeout with cancellation for debouncing
- Implement AbortController for request cancellation
- Use Map for O(1) cache lookups
- Consider WeakMap for memory efficiency
- Use performance.now() for accurate timing

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Completion Provider, Context Extraction
- Blocks: Smooth user experience

## Performance Targets
- Debounce delay: 100-300ms adaptive
- Cache hit rate: >70%
- Request cancellation rate: <30%
- Memory overhead: <50MB
- Context extraction: <50ms

## Estimated Effort
- 8-10 hours for core implementation
- 12-14 hours including monitoring and optimization
