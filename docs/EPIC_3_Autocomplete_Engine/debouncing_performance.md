# User Story: Debouncing and Performance Optimization

## Story Description

As a developer, I want completions to be performant and not interfere with my typing flow so that I can code smoothly without lag or unnecessary API calls.

## Action Items

### 1. Implement Intelligent Debouncing

- [x] Create `DebouncedCompletionManager` class
- [x] Implement adaptive debounce timing based on typing speed
- [x] Add different debounce delays for different triggers
- [x] Create immediate trigger for specific characters (., ->, ::)
- [x] Implement debounce cancellation on navigation

### 2. Cancel In-flight Requests

- [x] Implement request cancellation tokens
- [x] Create `RequestManager` with AbortController
- [x] Cancel pending requests on new input
- [x] Handle partial responses gracefully
- [x] Clean up cancelled request resources

### 3. Implement Completion Cache

- [x] Create `CompletionCache` with LRU eviction
- [x] Cache completions by context hash
- [x] Implement cache invalidation rules
- [x] Add TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries
- [x] Create cache size limits and monitoring

### 4. Optimize Context Processing

- [x] Implement incremental context updates
- [x] Use diff algorithms for context changes
- [x] Parallelize context extraction tasks
- [x] Implement context compression strategies
- [x] Add context preprocessing cache

### 5. Add Performance Monitoring

- [x] Implement performance metrics collection
- [x] Track completion latency percentiles
- [x] Monitor cache hit rates
- [x] Log slow completion requests
- [x] Create performance debugging commands

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No perceived lag while typing quickly
- [ ] API calls reduced by >70% with caching
- [ ] Completions appear within 200ms consistently
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 50MB
- [ ] CPU usage <5% during normal coding
- [ ] Graceful degradation under load

## Test Cases

### Debouncing Tests

1. **Fast Typing**: No completions during rapid input
2. **Pause Trigger**: Completion after typing pause
3. **Immediate Trigger**: Instant on dot notation
4. **Cancellation**: Moving cursor cancels request

### Request Management Tests

1. **Cancellation**: Old requests abort properly
2. **Cleanup**: No memory leaks from cancelled requests
3. **Race Conditions**: Latest request wins
4. **Error Handling**: Cancelled requests don't error

### Cache Tests

1. **Cache Hit**: Repeated context uses cache
2. **Cache Miss**: New context fetches from API
3. **Invalidation**: File changes clear cache
4. **Size Limit**: Old entries evicted at limit
5. **TTL**: Expired entries are removed

### Performance Tests

1. **Latency**: P95 latency <200ms
2. **Memory**: <50MB memory usage
3. **CPU**: <5% CPU during coding
4. **Large Files**: No lag in large files
5. **Stress Test**: Handles rapid requests

### Monitoring Tests

1. **Metrics**: All metrics collected accurately
2. **Logging**: Performance logs are useful
3. **Debugging**: Debug commands work
4. **Reporting**: Can export performance data

## Edge Cases

- Network latency variations
- API throttling/rate limits
- Very fast typists (>150 WPM)
- Slow machines/limited resources
- Large workspace with many files
- Concurrent editing in multiple files
- Extension reload during requests

## Technical Notes

- Use setTimeout with cancellation for debouncing
- Implement AbortController for request cancellation
- Use Map for O(1) cache lookups
- Consider WeakMap for memory efficiency
- Use performance.now() for accurate timing

## Dependencies

- Depends on: Completion Provider, Context Extraction
- Blocks: Smooth user experience

## Performance Targets

- Debounce delay: 100-300ms adaptive
- Cache hit rate: >70%
- Request cancellation rate: <30%
- Memory overhead: <50MB
- Context extraction: <50ms

## Estimated Effort

- 8-10 hours for core implementation
- 12-14 hours including monitoring and optimization
