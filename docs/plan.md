## Appendix

### A. Technology Alternatives Considered

1. **Language**: Considered JavaScript but chose TypeScript for better type safety
2. **Build Tool**: Considered Webpack but chose esbuild for faster builds
3. **Testing**: Considered Mocha but chose Jest for better integration

### B. Reference Architecture

Based on analysis of:
- Continue extension (open-source reference)
- GitHub Copilot (UX patterns)
- VSCode extension best practices

### C. Security Considerations

1. Never log or expose authentication tokens
2. Use VSCode SecretStorage for credential storage
