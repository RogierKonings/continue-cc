# Autocomplete Engine Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the AI-powered autocomplete engine for Claude Code Continue.

## Architecture Overview

The autocomplete engine is built with several key components:

### 1. Completion Provider (`providers/claudeCompletionProvider.ts`)

- Implements VSCode's `CompletionItemProvider` and `InlineCompletionItemProvider` interfaces
- Handles both standard completions (dropdown) and inline completions (ghost text)
- Coordinates between context extraction, caching, and debouncing

### 2. Context Extraction (`context/contextExtractor.ts`)

- Extracts relevant context from the current file and workspace
- Captures imports, symbols, project structure, and code patterns
- Provides intelligent context window management
- Supports multiple programming languages

### 3. Debouncing & Performance (`performance/debouncedCompletionManager.ts`)

- Implements adaptive debouncing based on typing speed
- Manages request cancellation for in-flight API calls
- Provides immediate triggers for special characters (., ->, ::, etc.)
- Ensures <200ms latency for completion responses

### 4. Completion Cache (`cache/completionCache.ts`)

- LRU cache with TTL (time-to-live) support
- Memory-bounded caching (50MB limit)
- Context-aware cache key generation
- Performance metrics and monitoring

### 5. Configuration (`config/autocompleteConfig.ts`)

- User-configurable settings for autocomplete behavior
- Supports workspace-specific configurations
- Dynamic configuration updates

### 6. Registry (`completionProviderRegistry.ts`)

- Manages registration of completion providers for different languages
- Handles command registration
- Coordinates provider lifecycle

## Key Features

### Multi-Language Support

- JavaScript/TypeScript (including JSX/TSX)
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- Go
- Rust
- And many more...

### Performance Optimizations

- Adaptive debouncing (100-300ms based on typing speed)
- Request cancellation for obsolete completions
- Smart caching with >70% hit rate target
- Incremental context updates
- Memory-efficient implementation (<50MB)

### Context Awareness

- Import statement parsing
- Symbol extraction (classes, methods, variables)
- Project structure understanding
- Framework detection
- Related file discovery

## Usage

The autocomplete engine is automatically registered when the extension activates. Users can configure behavior through VSCode settings:

```json
{
  "continue-cc.autocomplete.enabled": true,
  "continue-cc.autocomplete.automaticTrigger": true,
  "continue-cc.autocomplete.minimumCharacters": 2,
  "continue-cc.autocomplete.completionDelay": 200,
  "continue-cc.autocomplete.maxCompletions": 20
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

- Unit tests for each component
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory leak prevention tests
- Stress testing with 100+ concurrent requests

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Deep code analysis for more intelligent completions
2. **Multi-file Context**: Include related files in context for better suggestions
3. **Learning**: Adapt to user's coding patterns over time
4. **Team Sharing**: Share completion patterns across team members
5. **Custom Models**: Support for different AI models based on use case

## Performance Targets

- Completion latency: <200ms (P95)
- Cache hit rate: >70%
- Memory usage: <50MB
- CPU usage: <5% during normal coding
- API call reduction: >70% through caching and debouncing
